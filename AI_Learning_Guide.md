## 🌟 What Is AI Good At?  
Think of ChatGPT as a **super helpful study buddy** — not a robot that does your homework.  
Here's what it’s great for:

✅ Explaining confusing stuff in **simple terms**  
✅ Brainstorming **ideas** when you're stuck  
✅ Creating **practice questions** for revision  
✅ Giving **feedback** on drafts  
✅ Turning **bullet points** into sentences (after you come up with the ideas!)  
✅ Helping you **plan** your writing  

> 🧠 **KEY RULE:** If the ideas aren't yours, the learning isn't yours.

---

## 🚫 What NOT to Use AI For

❌ Copying and pasting full answers  
❌ Writing entire assignments for you  
❌ Submitting AI-generated work as your own  
❌ Asking for answers to tests or essays you haven’t tried  

> 🔎 Teachers and software can detect AI writing. But more importantly, **you're cheating yourself**.

## 🛠️ How to Use ChatGPT to Help You Learn (Not Cheat)

### 1. 💬 Ask for Clarification  
**Don't understand something in class?**  
Ask:  
```
Can you explain [topic] like I’m 14?
```

🎯 Use this to get the *gist*, then go back to your notes or textbook for depth.

---

### 2. 🧠 Use It to Test Your Knowledge  
**Already studied something?** Check your understanding:  
```
Give me 5 quiz questions about [topic] at Level 1 NCEA.
```

✅ Try to answer first before checking!

---

### 3. 📝 Brainstorm — Then Do the Work Yourself  
**Stuck on an essay or creative task?** Use AI to generate prompts:  
```
Help me brainstorm ideas for a creative story about resilience.
```

🌱 Pick your favorite idea and grow it **your way**.

---

### 4. 🔍 Ask for Feedback, Not a Rewrite  
Wrote something already? Improve it:  
```
Can you give me feedback on this paragraph? What could I improve?
```

🛠️ Make the changes **yourself** based on the suggestions.

---

### 5. 🧭 Use It to Plan, Not to Write  
**Got a big assignment?** Ask for structure, not the full thing:  
```
What’s a good structure for a research report on climate change?
```

🗺️ Use the outline to organise your ideas.

## 🎨 Example: Using AI the Right Way for a Creative Task

### ❌ *Cheating:*  
> “Write a 600-word short story about overcoming fear.”

👎 You’ve done nothing. You’ve learned nothing. It’s not your work.

### ✅ *Learning Support:*  
> “Can you help me come up with some themes or plot twists for a story about overcoming fear?”

👍 You still write it. It’s still yours. You’ve used AI like a coach, not a ghostwriter.

## 🧠 Final Tips

💡 **Think of AI as a torch, not a crutch.** It helps you *see*, but you’ve still got to *walk*.  
💡 **Always reflect:** “Did this help me understand better or just save me time?”  
💡 **Own your learning.** It's your brain, your creativity, your future.
