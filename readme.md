# Welcome to Digital Technology (NCEA LEVEL 2) at Wainuiomata High School

This repository contains all the resources for NCEA Digital Technologies at Wainuiomata High School.   

## Why a GitHub repository?

Git is an industry-standard tool for developers, and GitHub is the cloud space that brings the version control, wikis, project management tools
all into one space. 

We will be using GitHub as our primary way of managing storage of code, version control, collaboration and documentation.
